## Description

This project required building a Node.js command-line application which takes in information about employees on a team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each integrant.
There are tests for each part of the code using Jest to ensure that it passes them.

When prompted for team members and their information, then an HTML is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.
